# Linux TSN Testbench

## About

The Linux TSN `Testbench` is a real-time and non-real time traffic validation
tool for converged TSN networks. PROFINET as well as OPC/UA PubSub and other
configurable protocols are supported. Furthermore, the performance validation of
security algorithms can be utilized. The evaluation application is primarily
used to simulate a PLC. It generates RT and non-RT traffic, mirrors traffic and
performs consistency and latency checks. The Linux TSN `Testbench` is split
into two applications:

- `reference`: Traffic generation and checking simulation
- `mirror`: Traffic mirror application for traffic generated by `reference`
  application

The concept is shown below.

### Motivation

Over the last years the Linux kernel and open source ecosystem in general
introduced TSN functionalities. This includes the time synchronization with PTP
via 802.1AS, various traffic shapers defined by IEEE and deterministic frame
reception and transmission. Furthermore, the PREEMPT_RT patch turns Linux into a
real-time Operating-System. How well do these mechanisms perform for real world
use cases? For instance, is it possible to run PROFINET over TSN on top of
Linux? Which jitter, cycle times, throughputs and latencies can be achieved?

To answer these questions, the Linux TSN `Testbench` has been developed. The
purpose of that tool is to evaluate manufacturerâ€™s hardware as well as
underlying drivers and the Linux network stack itself. Thereby, please note that
is not a TSN conformance testing tool, it is intended for evaluation. The tool
itself is independent of any hardware manufacturers. All used TSN mechanisms are
utilizing mainline Linux only utilities for data and control plane.

While the development of the tool started for PROFINET RT and later TSN, it is
now able to generate any kind of cyclic Ethernet payload. This way, different
`middlewares` next to PROFINET such as OPC/UA can be simulated and tested.

The overall idea is shown below.

### Architecture

The application itself performs cyclic Ethernet communication. There are
different traffic classes ranging from real time Layer 2 up to UDP
communication. The cyclic receivers and transmitters utilize either traditional
`AF_PACKET` or modern `AF_XDP` sockets. For both socket types the receive
flow is configured via either BPF filters or eBPF XDP programs. Based on the
configuration, or profiles, the Linux TSN `Testbench` can simulate different
traffic types such as PROFINET or OPC/UA PubSub. The image below shows an
example of three different middlewares in combination with non-real time
applications utilizing XDP.
